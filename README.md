This script will protect against bringing a Dreadsylvania zone below 10 monsters left, and it will also abort if it notices someone else adventuring in the zone with you. 

Bring up any issues in the thread on the Ascension Speed Show discord (`/tag dread preadventure script`)!

To install, enter `git checkout SaucedButLeaking/safeDread release` in mafia's cli

To enable; run `safeDread` 

TODO: easy disable 

UNTESTED: if you're looking to finish clearing out one of the zones, enter `set _safeDread_clear="Forest"` (or "Village" or "Castle")
